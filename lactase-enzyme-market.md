<p><p>Lactase enzyme is an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It helps in the digestion of lactose by breaking it down into simpler sugars, glucose, and galactose. This enzyme is usually produced in the small intestine of mammals, including humans. However, some people have a deficiency in lactase production, leading to lactose intolerance, where the consumption of dairy products can cause digestive discomfort.</p><p>The lactase enzyme market is witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of lactose intolerance worldwide. Rising awareness about lactose intolerance and its symptoms among consumers is driving the demand for lactase enzyme supplements and products. Additionally, the growing trend of adopting dairy-free and lactose-free diets is also contributing to the market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the rising popularity of dairy alternatives, such as plant-based milk products, is further propelling the demand for lactase enzyme. These products often require the addition of lactase enzyme during their manufacturing process to provide lactose-free options for consumers.</p><p>Furthermore, advancements in enzyme technology and the development of novel lactase enzyme formulations are also driving the market growth. Manufacturers are focusing on developing more efficient and stable lactase enzyme products to cater to the increasing demand.</p><p>According to market analysis, the lactase enzyme market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing awareness and demand for lactase enzyme products, coupled with the rising adoption of lactose-free diets and dairy alternatives. The market is likely to witness further expansion as more consumers become aware of lactose intolerance and seek lactase enzyme supplements and lactose-free food and beverage products.</p></p>
