<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dye Transfer Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PVP Polymers</li><li>Chromabond Polymers</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dye transfer inhibitors are substances that are used in laundry detergents to prevent the transfer of colors between different fabrics during the washing process. There are several types of dye transfer inhibitors available in the market. PVP polymers and Chromabond polymers are two common types. PVP polymers work by forming a protective barrier around the dye molecules, preventing them from attaching to other fabrics. Chromabond polymers work similarly by binding to the dye molecules and suspending them in the wash water. Other types of dye transfer inhibitors may also exist in the market, offering different mechanisms for preventing color transfer.</p></p>
