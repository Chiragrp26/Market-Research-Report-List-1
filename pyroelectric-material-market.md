<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pyroelectric Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ferroelectric Crystal</li><li>Pyroelectric Ceramics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pyroelectric materials are categorized into two main types: ferroelectric crystals and pyroelectric ceramics. Ferroelectric crystals possess spontaneous polarization, allowing them to change their polarization direction under the influence of temperature variations. This property makes them useful in various applications such as sensors and detectors. On the other hand, pyroelectric ceramics exhibit a similar pyroelectric effect but do not possess the spontaneous polarization found in ferroelectric crystals. These ceramics are also utilized in diverse fields like infrared sensors and thermal imaging devices.</p></p>
