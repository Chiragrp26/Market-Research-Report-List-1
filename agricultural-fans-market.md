<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural fans are used in various farming operations to facilitate proper ventilation and air circulation. There are two main types of agricultural fans: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans work by drawing air into the fan housing and then expelling it at a higher pressure. This type of fan is commonly used for cooling applications. On the other hand, axial fans move air by pulling it in parallel to the fan shaft and then blowing it out in the same direction. Axial fans are typically used for general ventilation purposes in agricultural settings.</p></p>
