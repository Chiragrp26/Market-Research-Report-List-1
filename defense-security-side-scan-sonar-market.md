<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defense & Security Side Scan Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Multi-beam</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Defense & Security Side Scan Sonar market includes two main types: Single-beam and Multi-beam. Single-beam sonars emit a single sound beam that scans a narrow strip of the seabed, providing basic imagery and depth measurements. They are cost-effective and commonly used for shallow-water applications. On the other hand, Multi-beam sonars use multiple beams to provide high-resolution, detailed images of the seabed over a larger area. They are more expensive but offer superior accuracy and efficiency, making them suitable for deep-water mapping and advanced defense and security operations.</p></p>
