<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Absorption</li><li>Chemical Absorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Desiccants are substances used to absorb moisture and control humidity in various industries. Physical absorption desiccants work by attracting and holding water molecules on their surface through physical forces such as Van der Waals interactions. Chemical absorption desiccants, on the other hand, chemically react with water molecules to remove moisture from the air. Both types play important roles in preventing mold, corrosion, and degradation in products and environments by effectively reducing humidity levels.</p></p>
