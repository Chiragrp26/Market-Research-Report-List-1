<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Studs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injectable Adhensive Anchors</li><li>Capsule Adhensive Anchors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Chemical Studs market consists of two main types: Injectable Adhesive Anchors and Capsule Adhesive Anchors. Injectable Adhesive Anchors involve injecting a chemical adhesive into a pre-drilled hole, which then cures and bonds the anchor to the surrounding material. Capsule Adhesive Anchors, on the other hand, use a pre-packaged capsule containing a resin and a hardener. When the capsule is inserted into a drilled hole and crushed, the resin and hardener mix, creating a strong adhesive bond. Both types of anchors provide reliable and secure fastening solutions in various construction and industrial applications.</p></p>
