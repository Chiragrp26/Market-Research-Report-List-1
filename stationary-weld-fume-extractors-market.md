<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Weld Fume Extractors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatically Cleaned</li><li>Manually Cleaned</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stationary weld fume extractors are devices used to capture and remove harmful fumes generated during welding processes. They are available in two types: automatically cleaned and manually cleaned. Automatically cleaned extractors feature a self-cleaning mechanism that dislodges deposited particles, ensuring continuous and efficient operation with minimal maintenance. On the other hand, manually cleaned extractors require regular maintenance and cleaning by the operator. Both types offer effective filtration and air purification, but the automatic cleaning feature in certain models enhances convenience and reduces downtime.</p></p>
