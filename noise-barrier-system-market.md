<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structure Mounted</li><li>Ground Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noise barrier system market includes two main types: structure mounted and ground mounted barriers. Structure mounted barriers are fixed to existing structures, such as walls or bridges, and can effectively reduce noise levels by absorbing or reflecting sound waves. On the other hand, ground mounted barriers are freestanding structures positioned along roads or highways, and they work by blocking direct sound transmission. Both types of barriers are used to mitigate noise pollution and create quieter and more peaceful environments.</p></p>
