<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Pancreas Device System (APDS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threshold Suspended Device Systems</li><li>Hybrid Closed-loop APDS</li><li>Other Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Pancreas Device System (APDS) market consists of three main types: threshold suspended device systems, hybrid closed-loop APDS, and other systems. Threshold suspended device systems monitor glucose levels and suspend insulin delivery when the glucose levels fall below a certain threshold. Hybrid closed-loop APDS combine continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery to regulate glucose levels in real-time. Other systems refer to APDS that do not fit into these two categories, such as those in the early stages of development or different approaches to manage glucose levels.</p></p>
