<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Toilet Tank Fill Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Ball</li><li>Float Cup</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial toilet tank fill valve market consists of two main types: float ball and float cup. Float ball valves use a large ball attached to an arm that rises and falls with the water level in the tank. As the water level drops, the arm lowers, opening a valve to allow water to enter and fill the tank. Float cup valves, on the other hand, use a cup-shaped device that floats on the water's surface. When the water level lowers, the cup descends, triggering the valve to open and refill the tank. Both types function to maintain the water level in the toilet tank.</p></p>
