<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Grade Urea Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granule</li><li>Powder</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The feed grade urea market is divided into two main types: granule and powder. Granule urea refers to urea in a solid form made up of small, round particles. It is easier to handle, has a slow-release effect, and is commonly used in animal feed. Powder urea, on the other hand, refers to urea in a fine, powdered form. It has a faster release rate and is often used in the production of liquid feed or as a supplement in animal feed. Both types have their own advantages and applications in the feed grade urea market.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Feed Grade Urea Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cattle</li><li>Sheep</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Feed grade urea is widely used in the cattle, sheep, and other livestock markets. It serves as a nitrogen supplement in animal nutrition, promoting the growth and development of rumen microbes, which improve the digestion of forage and other feeds. In cattle, feed grade urea helps enhance the utilization of low-protein diets, particularly in feedlots and grazing operations. Similarly, it aids in the metabolism of urea in sheep, enabling them to efficiently utilize non-protein nitrogen sources for protein synthesis. Other livestock, such as goats and horses, also benefit from the supplementation of feed grade urea for improved feed efficiency and overall health.</p></p>
