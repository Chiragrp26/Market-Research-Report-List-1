<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Balanced Shaft Gear</li><li>Single Balance Shaft Gear</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive air brake market can be divided into two types: Double Balanced Shaft Gear and Single Balance Shaft Gear. </p><p>In Double Balanced Shaft Gear, a pair of balanced gears rotate independently to ensure the torque remains balanced, resulting in reduced vibrations and noise. This makes it suitable for heavy-duty vehicles, providing optimal performance and durability. </p><p>On the other hand, Single Balance Shaft Gear uses a single gear that requires less maintenance and is ideal for light-duty vehicles. Both types enhance vehicle safety and braking efficiency, catering to different vehicle needs.</p></p>
