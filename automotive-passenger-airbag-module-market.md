<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Passenger Airbag Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Electronic Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive passenger airbag module market comprises two types: mechanical type and electronic type. The mechanical type airbag module relies on sensors to detect a collision, triggers an inflator, and causes the airbag to inflate. It uses mechanical components to initiate these actions. In contrast, the electronic type airbag module incorporates electronic sensors and processors to analyze crash signals and determine the severity of the impact. It then activates the inflator to timely inflate the airbag for passenger safety. Both types serve the same purpose of protecting vehicle occupants in the event of a collision.</p></p>
