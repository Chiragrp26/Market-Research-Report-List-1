<p><p>Waterborne polyurethane (PUD) refers to a type of polyurethane that is dispersed in water. There are several types of waterborne PUDs available in the market including anionic PUDs, cationic PUDs, and non-ionic PUDs. Anionic PUDs have a negatively charged particle dispersion, while cationic PUDs have a positively charged particle dispersion. Non-ionic PUDs have no charge on their particles. Component polyurethane refers to a single-component PUD that does not require any additional mixing. Two-component polyurethane, on the other hand, consists of separate components that are mixed before application. Urethane-modified PUDs are waterborne polyurethanes modified with urethane to enhance their properties.</p></p>
