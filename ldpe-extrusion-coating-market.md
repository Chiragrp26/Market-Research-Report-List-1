<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Extrusion Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Process</li><li>Autoclave Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>LDPE extrusion coating is a process used to apply a layer of LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) onto paper, film, or other substrates to provide a protective or functional coating. The tubular process involves the extrusion of LDPE through a circular die, creating a tube-like structure that is immediately collapsed onto the substrate. The autoclave process, on the other hand, utilizes a high-pressure autoclave reactor to produce LDPE, which is then processed through an extruder before being applied onto the substrate. These processes are commonly used in industries such as packaging, food and beverage, and textiles.</p></p>
