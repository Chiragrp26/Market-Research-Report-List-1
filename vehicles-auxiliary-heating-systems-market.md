<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicles Auxiliary Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fuel Based Auxiliary Heaters</li><li>Electrical / PTC Auxiliary Heaters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle auxiliary heating systems market consists of two main types: fuel-based auxiliary heaters and electrical/PTC auxiliary heaters. Fuel-based auxiliary heaters utilize various types of fuel, such as diesel or gasoline, to generate heat, which is then distributed into the vehicle's interior. On the other hand, electrical/PTC auxiliary heaters use an electrical system or a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) heating element to generate heat. Both types of auxiliary heaters serve the purpose of providing additional heating to vehicles during colder weather conditions.</p></p>
