<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiator Thermostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angled</li><li>Straight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiator thermostats are devices used to control the temperature of radiators in heating systems. There are two main types of radiator thermostats: angled and straight. Angled radiator thermostats are designed to be installed at an angle, typically at the bottom of the radiator. This allows for easier access and adjustment of the thermostat. On the other hand, straight radiator thermostats are designed to be installed vertically on the side of the radiator. This type of installation is commonly used when there is limited space or specific aesthetics to consider. Both angled and straight radiator thermostats serve the same purpose of regulating the heat output of radiators.</p></p>
