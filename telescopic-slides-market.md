<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Telescopic Slides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Extension Type</li><li>Partial Extension Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Telescopic slides are widely used in industries for smooth and precise sliding motion of various objects. Full extension type refers to slides that can extend fully, allowing the object to be completely pulled out of the enclosure or cabinet. They provide maximum access to the object. On the other hand, partial extension type telescopic slides allow the object to be partially extended, leaving a portion inside the enclosure. This type is suitable when full extension is not required or space constraints are present. Both types cater to different needs and applications in the market.</p></p>
