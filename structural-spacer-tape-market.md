<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Spacer Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Sided</li><li>Single Sided</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Structural spacer tape is a product used in various industries for creating gaps, providing adhesion, or offering cushioning between two surfaces. The market for structural spacer tape consists of two main types: double-sided and single-sided. Double-sided spacer tape has adhesive on both sides, allowing it to stick to two surfaces simultaneously. This type is commonly used for joining materials where bonding strength is required on both sides. In contrast, single-sided spacer tape has adhesive on only one side, often used for applications where adhesion on one surface is sufficient or where one side needs to be removable.</p></p>
