<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Ignition Magneto Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-contain System</li><li>Battery Powered System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive ignition magneto market consists of two types of systems: self-contained and battery powered. Self-contained systems are independent and do not require an external power source. They generate their own electricity through a spinning magnet and distribute it to the ignition coil. On the other hand, battery-powered systems rely on an external power source, usually a battery, to generate electricity and power the ignition coil. Both systems serve the same purpose of providing the necessary spark to ignite the fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of an automotive engine.</p></p>
