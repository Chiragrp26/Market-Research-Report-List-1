<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Grade Zirconium Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hafnium-free Zirconium</li><li>Commercial-grade Zirconium</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Nuclear Grade Zirconium is divided into two market types: Hafnium-free Zirconium and Commercial-grade Zirconium. Hafnium-free Zirconium is a higher purity form of zirconium that is required for nuclear applications, as hafnium can impede the effectiveness of fuel rods in nuclear reactors. Commercial-grade Zirconium, on the other hand, is a lower purity form that is used in non-nuclear applications such as chemical processing, aerospace, and medical industries. Both market types cater to different industries and have varying levels of purity based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
