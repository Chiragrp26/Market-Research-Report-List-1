<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Healing</li><li>Capsule Based Healing</li><li>Vascular Healing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-healing concrete is a type of concrete that has the ability to repair cracks on its own, increasing its durability and minimizing maintenance costs. There are three main types of self-healing concrete: intrinsic healing, capsule-based healing, and vascular healing. Intrinsic healing uses chemical reactions within the concrete to seal cracks. Capsule-based healing involves embedding water-activated capsules containing healing agents in the concrete, which rupture when cracks occur, releasing the healing agents. Vascular healing involves embedding a network of tiny tubes in the concrete that can transport healing agents to the crack site when damage occurs.</p></p>
