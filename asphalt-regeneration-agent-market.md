<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Regeneration Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat-In-Place Regeneration</li><li>Plant Mix Hot Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Asphalt Regeneration Agent market includes two main types: Heat-In-Place Regeneration and Plant Mix Hot Regeneration. Heat-In-Place Regeneration involves heating the existing asphalt pavement to a high temperature and adding a rejuvenating agent to restore its strength and properties. Plant Mix Hot Regeneration, on the other hand, entails removing the old asphalt pavement, taking it to an off-site plant to blend it with a rejuvenating agent, and then reusing it as a new mixture. Both methods aim to effectively recycle and regenerate asphalt materials for sustainable road construction.</p></p>
