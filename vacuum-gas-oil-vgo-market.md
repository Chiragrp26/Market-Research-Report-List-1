<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO)</li><li>Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) refers to a type of oil derived from the refining process. It is further categorized into two market types: Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO) and Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO). HVGO is a thicker, denser VGO variant that contains a higher proportion of heavy hydrocarbons. LVGO, on the other hand, is a lighter and less viscous VGO variant, typically with a higher content of lighter hydrocarbons. These differential properties make HVGO more suitable for high-sulfur fuel oil production, while LVGO is commonly used for gasoline and diesel production.</p></p>
