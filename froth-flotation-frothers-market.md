<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Froth Flotation Frothers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Active Agent</li><li>Nonsurfactant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Froth flotation frothers are chemicals used in mineral processing to stabilize bubbles and enhance the efficiency of the flotation process. Surface active agents are a type of frother that function by reducing the surface tension of the liquid, allowing the formation of stable froths. On the other hand, nonsurfactant frothers do not possess surface tension reduction properties but instead work by forming strong interfacial films between gas and liquid phases. Both types play vital roles in separating valuable minerals from their ores during flotation.</p></p>
