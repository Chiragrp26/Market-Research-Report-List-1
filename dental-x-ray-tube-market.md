<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X-ray Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Anode</li><li>Rotating Anode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Dental X-ray Tube Market consists of two types: Stationary Anode and Rotating Anode. In Stationary Anode tubes, the anode remains fixed during operation, which makes them more durable and suitable for routine dental imaging. On the other hand, Rotating Anode tubes have a spinning anode that allows for higher power and faster exposure times, making them ideal for advanced dental procedures. Both types serve specific purposes in dental X-ray machines and cater to different needs of dental practitioners.</p></p>
