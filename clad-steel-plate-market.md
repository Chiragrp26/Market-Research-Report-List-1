<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clad Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Clad steel plate market types include explosion bonded and roll bonded. In the explosion bonded process, a layer of metal is explosively bonded to another metal substrate, creating a strong bond without the use of heat. This method allows for the combination of different types of metals. On the other hand, in the roll bonded process, two or more layers of metal are passed through high-pressure rollers, creating a solid bond. This process is commonly used for combining dissimilar metals with different mechanical properties efficiently.</p></p>
